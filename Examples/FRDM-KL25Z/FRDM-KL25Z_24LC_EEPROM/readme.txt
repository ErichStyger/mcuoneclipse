==========
This project uses the Microchip 24AA/24LC external I2C EEPROM with the FRDM-KL25Z.

Pin connections of 24LC to FRDM-KL25Z:
1: (A0)  NC
2: (A1)  NC
3: (A0)  NC
4: (Vss) GND
5: (SDA) J10 PTB1
6: (SCL) J10 PTB0
7: (WP)  NC
8: (VCC) 3.3V

Note: SDA and SCL require a pull-up resistor (e.g. 10k) to Vcc
