**         characters to the bus. If the ERR_NOTAVAIL error code is
**         returned, the whole block is successfully sent to a master
**         but the master device responds by an acknowledgment instead
**         of no acknowledgment sent at the end of the last block byte
**         transfer. 'OnError' event is called in this case.
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**       * Ptr             - A pointer to the block of data to send
**         Siz             - The size of the block
**       * Snt             - A pointer to the number of data that are
**                           sent (copied to buffer)
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - Error code, possible codes:
**                           ERR_OK - OK
**                           ERR_SPEED - This device does not work in
**                           the active speed mode
**                           ERR_BUSY - The slave device is busy, it
**                           does not respond by the acknowledgment
**                           (MASTER mode only)
**                           ERR_TXFULL - Output buffer is full (MASTER
**                           mode only)
**                           ERR_NOTAVAIL - The master device sends
**                           acknowledgment instead of no acknowledgment
**                           after the last byte transfer (SLAVE mode
**                           only)
**                           ERR_DISABLED - Device is disabled
**                           ERR_BUSOFF - Clock timeout elapsed (SLAVE
**                           mode only)
