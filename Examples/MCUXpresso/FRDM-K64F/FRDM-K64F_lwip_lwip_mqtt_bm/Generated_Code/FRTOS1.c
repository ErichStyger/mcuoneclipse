**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         pvTaskCode      - Pointer to the task entry
**                           function. Tasks must be implemented to
**                           never return (i.e. continuous loop).
**         pcName          - A descriptive name for the task.
**                           This is mainly used to facilitate debugging.

**         pvParameters    - Pointer that will be
**                           used as the parameter for the task being
**                           created.

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_vTaskDelay (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Delay a task for a given number of ticks. The actual time
**         that the task remains blocked depends on the tick rate. The
**         constant portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real time
**         from the tick rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
**         vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to
**         unblock relative to the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.
**         For example, specifying a block period of 100 ticks will
**         cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after vTaskDelay() is
**         called. vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good
**         method of controlling the frequency of a cyclical task as
**         the path taken through the code, as well as other task and
**         interrupt activity, will effect the frequency at which
**         vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the
**         task next executes. See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative
**         API function designed to facilitate fixed frequency
**         execution. It does this by specifying an absolute time
**         (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task
**         should unblock. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xTicksToDelay   - The amount of time, in
**                           tick periods, that the calling task should
**                           block.

** ===================================================================
**     Method      :  FRTOS1_vTaskDelayUntil (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Delay a task until a specified time. This function can be
**         used by cyclical tasks to ensure a constant execution
**         frequency.
**         This function differs from vTaskDelay() in one important
**         aspect: vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task
**         wishes to unblock relative to the time at which vTaskDelay()
**         is called, whereas vTaskDelayUntil() specifies an absolute
**         time at which the task wishes to unblock.
**         vTaskDelay() will cause a task to block for the specified
**         number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay() is called. It is
**         therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay() by itself to
**         generate a fixed execution frequency as the time between a
**         task unblocking following a call to vTaskDelay() and that
**         task next calling vTaskDelay() may not be fixed [the task
**         may take a different path though the code between calls, or
**         may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
**         each time it executes].
**         Whereas vTaskDelay() specifies a wake time relative to the
**         time at which the function is called, vTaskDelayUntil()
**         specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
**         unblock.
**         It should be noted that vTaskDelayUntil() will return
**         immediately (without blocking) if it is used to specify a
**         wake time that is already in the past. Therefore a task
**         using vTaskDelayUntil() to execute periodically will have to
**         re-calculate its required wake time if the periodic
**         execution is halted for any reason (for example, the task is
**         temporarily placed into the Suspended state) causing the
**         task to miss one or more periodic executions. This can be
**         detected by checking the variable passed by reference as the
**         pxPreviousWakeTime parameter against the current tick count.
**         This is however not necessary under most usage scenarios.
**         The constant portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to calculate real
**         time from the tick rate - with the resolution of one tick
**         period.
**         This function must not be called while the scheduler has
**         been suspended by a call to vTaskSuspendAll(). 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         pxPreviousWakeTime - Pointer to a
**                           variable that holds the time at which the
**                           task was last unblocked. The variable must
**                           be initialised with the current time prior
**                           to its first use (see the example below).
**                           Following this the variable is
**                           automatically updated within
**                           vTaskDelayUntil(). 
**         xTimeIncrement  - The cycle time
**                           period. The task will be unblocked at time
**                           (*pxPreviousWakeTime + xTimeIncrement).
**                           Calling vTaskDelayUntil with the same
**                           xTimeIncrement parameter value will cause
**                           the task to execute with a fixed interval

**     Description :
**         Macro that implements a recursive mutex by using the
**         existing queue mechanism.
**         Mutexes created using this macro can be accessed using the
**         xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() and xSemaphoreGiveRecursive()
**         macros.  The  xSemaphoreTake() and xSemaphoreGive() macros
**         should not be used.
**         A mutex used recursively can be 'taken' repeatedly by the
**         owner. The mutex doesn't become available again until the
**         owner has called xSemaphoreGiveRecursive() for each
**         successful 'take' request.  For example, if a task
**         successfully 'takes' the same mutex 5 times then the mutex
**         will not be available to any other task until it has also
**         'given' the mutex back exactly five times.
**         This type of semaphore uses a priority inheritance mechanism
**         so a task 'taking' a semaphore MUST ALWAYS 'give' the
**         semaphore back once the semaphore it is no longer required.
**         Mutex type semaphores cannot be used from within interrupt
**         service routines.
**         See vSemaphoreCreateBinary() for an alternative
**         implementation that can be used for pure synchronisation
**         (where one task or interrupt always 'gives' the semaphore
**         and another always 'takes' the semaphore) and from within
**         interrupt service routines.
**     Parameters  : None
**     Returns     :

**     Description :
**         Macro that creates a mutex semaphore by using the existing
**         queue mechanism.
**         Mutexes created using this macro can be accessed using the
**         xSemaphoreTake() and xSemaphoreGive() macros. The
**         xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() and xSemaphoreGiveRecursive()
**         macros should not be used.
**         Mutexes and binary semaphores are very similar but have some
**         subtle differences: Mutexes include a priority inheritance
**         mechanism, binary semaphores do not. This makes binary
**         semaphores the better choice for implementing
**         synchronisation (between tasks or between tasks and an
**         interrupt), and mutexes the better choice for implementing
**         simple mutual exclusion.
**         The priority of a task that 'takes' a mutex can potentially
**         be raised if another task of higher priority attempts to
**         obtain the same mutex. The task that owns the mutex
**         'inherits' the priority of the task attempting to 'take' the
**         same mutex. This means the mutex must always be 'given' back
**         - otherwise the higher priority task will never be able to
**         obtain the mutex, and the lower priority task will never
**         'disinherit' the priority. An example of a mutex being used
**         to implement mutual exclusion is provided on the
**         xSemaphoreTake() documentation page.
**         A binary semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so
**         task synchronisation can be implemented by one
**         task/interrupt continuously 'giving' the semaphore while
**         another continuously 'takes' the semaphore. This is
**         demonstrated by the sample code on the
**         xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() documentation page.
**         Both mutex and binary semaphores are assigned to variables
**         of type xSemaphoreHandle and can be used in any API function
**         that takes a parameter of this type. 
**     Parameters  : None
**     Returns     :

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xSemaphoreTake (component FreeRTOS)

**         within an interrupt if required, although this would not be
**         a normal operation. Semaphores use queues as their
**         underlying mechanism, so functions are to some extent
**         interoperable.
**         xSemaphoreTake() is part of the fully featured intertask

**         xMutex          - A handle to the mutex being obtained.
**                           This is the handle returned by
**                           xSemaphoreCreateMutex();
**         xBlockTime      - The time in ticks to wait
**                           for the semaphore to become available.  The
**                           macro portTICK_RATE_MS can be used to
**                           convert this to a real time.  A block time
**                           of zero can be used to poll the semaphore.
**                           If the task already owns the semaphore then
**                           xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() will return

**         This old vSemaphoreCreateBinary() macro is now deprecated in

**         binary semaphores created using the vSemaphoreCreateBinary()

**         created using xSemaphoreCreateBinary() are created in a
**         state such that the the semaphore must first be 'given'

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xSemaphoreCreateCounting (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Macro that creates a counting semaphore by using the
**         existing queue mechanism.
**         Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
**         1. Counting events.
**         In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a
**         semaphore each time an event occurs (incrementing the
**         semaphore count value), and a handler task will 'take' a
**         semaphore each time it processes an event (decrementing the
**         semaphore count value). The count value is therefore the
**         difference between the number of events that have occurred
**         and the number that have been processed. In this case it is
**         desirable for the initial count value to be zero.
**         2. Resource management.
**         In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number
**         of resources available. To obtain control of a resource a
**         task must first obtain a semaphore - decrementing the
**         semaphore count value. When the count value reaches zero
**         there are no free resources. When a task finishes with the
**         resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the
**         semaphore count value. In this case it is desirable for the
**         initial count value to be equal to the maximum count value,
**         indicating that all resources are free.
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         uxMaxCount      - The maximum count value that
**                           can be reached. When the semaphore reaches
**                           this value it can no longer be 'given'.
**         uxInitialCount  - The count value
**                           assigned to the semaphore when it is
**                           created.

**     Description :
**         configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS must be defined as 1 for this
**         function to be available. The application must also then
**         provide definitions for
**         portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS() and
**         portGET_RUN_TIME_COUNTER_VALUE to configure a peripheral
**         timer/counter and return the timers current count value
**         respectively. The counter should be at least 10 times the
**         frequency of the tick count.
**         NOTE: This function will disable interrupts for its duration.
**         It is not intended for normal application runtime use but as
**         a debug aid.
**         Setting configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS to 1 will result in a
**         total accumulated execution time being stored for each task.
**         The resolution of the accumulated time value depends on the
**         frequency of the timer configured by the
**         portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS() macro. Calling
**         vTaskGetRunTimeStats() writes the total execution time of
**         each task into a buffer, both as an absolute count value and
**         as a percentage of the total system execution time.

**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         pcWriteBuffer   - A buffer into which
**                           the execution times will be written, in

**                           large enough to contain the generated
**                           report. Approximately 40 bytes per task
**                           should be sufficient.

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xSemaphoreTakeFromISR (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Macro to take a semaphore from an ISR. The semaphore must

**         Mutex type semaphores (those created using a call to
**         xSemaphoreCreateMutex()) must not be used with this macro.
**         This macro can be used from an ISR, however taking a
**         semaphore from an ISR is not a common operation.  It is
**         likely to only be useful when taking a counting semaphore
**         when an interrupt is obtaining an object from a resource
**         pool (when the semaphore count indicates the number of
**         resources available).
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xSemaphore      - A handle to the semaphore
**                           being taken. This is the handle returned
**                           when the semaphore was created.
**       * pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken 
**                           - xSemaphoreTakeFromISR() will set

**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xQueue          - The handle of the queue from which
**                           the data is to be read.
**         pvBuffer        - A pointer to the memory into
**                           which the data read from the queue will be
**                           copied. The length of the buffer must be at
**                           least equal to the queue item size (set
**                           when the queue was created).
**         xTicksToWait    - The number of ticks for
**                           which the calling task should be held in
**                           the Blocked state to wait for data to
**                           become available from the queue should the
**                           queue already be empty.
**                           A value of zero will prevent the calling
**                           task from entering the Blocked state.
**                           If INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend is set to 1 then a
**                           value of portMAX_DELAY will hold the task
**                           in the Blocked state indefinitely to wait
**                           for data.
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - pdPASS: Data was successfully read from
**                           the queue. If a block time was specified
**                           then the calling task may have been
**                           temporarily placed into the Blocked state
**                           to wait for data to become available and
**                           data did become available before the block
**                           time expired.
**                           errQUEUE_EMPTY: The queue was empty so no
**                           date could be read form the queue. If a
**                           block time was specified then the calling
**                           task may have been temporarily placed into

**                           uxBitsToWaitFor must not be set to 0. 
**         xClearOnExit    - If xClearOnExit is set

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          Set bits (flags) within an RTOS event group. A version of
**         xEventGroupSetBits() that can be called from an interrupt
**         service routine (ISR).
**         Setting bits in an event group will automatically unblock
**         tasks that are blocked waiting for the bits.
**         Setting bits in an event group is not a deterministic
**         operation because there are an unknown number of tasks that
**         may be waiting for the bit or bits being set. FreeRTOS does
**         not allow non-deterministic operations to be performed in
**         interrupts or from critical sections. Therefore
**         xEventGroupSetBitFromISR() sends a message to the RTOS
**         daemon task to have the set operation performed in the
**         context of the daemon task - where a scheduler lock is used
**         in place of a critical section.
**         INCLUDE_xEventGroupSetBitFromISR, configUSE_TIMERS and
**         INCLUDE_xTimerPendFunctionCall must all be set to 1 in
**         FreeRTOSConfig.h for the xEventGroupSetBitsFromISR()
**         function to be available. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xEventGroup     - The event group in which
**                           the bits are to be set. The event group
**                           must have previously been created using a
**                           call to xEventGroupCreate(). 
**         uxBitsToSet     - A bitwise value that

**                           event group. For example, set uxBitsToSet
**                           to 0x08 to set only bit 3. Set uxBitsToSet
**                           to 0x09 to set bit 3 and bit 0. 
**         pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken 
**                           - Calling this function will result in a

**                           If the priority of the daemon task is
**                           higher than the priority of the currently
**                           running task (the task the interrupt

**                           indicating that a context switch should be
**                           requested before the interrupt exits. For
**                           that reason *pxHigherPriorityTaskWoken must
**                           be initialised to pdFALSE. See the example

**         pvTimerID       - An identifier that is assigned

**         pxCallbackFunction - The function

**         xTimerStart() starts a timer that was previously created

**         It is valid to call xTimerStart() before the RTOS scheduler
**         has been started, but when this is done the timer will not
**         actually start until the RTOS scheduler is started, and the
**         timers expiry time will be relative to when the RTOS

**         'n' is the timers defined period.
**         It is valid to call xTimerReset() before the RTOS scheduler
**         has been started, but when this is done the timer will not
**         actually start until the RTOS scheduler is started, and the

**         scheduler is started, not relative to when xTimerReset() was

**         The configUSE_TIMERS configuration constant must be set to 1

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          Used from application interrupt service routines to defer
**         the execution of a function to the RTOS daemon task (the
**         timer service task, hence this function is implemented in
**         timers.c and is prefixed with 'Timer').
**         Ideally an interrupt service routine (ISR) is kept as short
**         as possible, but sometimes an ISR either has a lot of
**         processing to do, or needs to perform processing that is not
**         deterministic. In these cases xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR()
**         can be used to defer processing of a function to the RTOS
**         daemon task.
**         A mechanism is provided that allows the interrupt to return
**         directly to the task that will subsequently execute the
**         pended function. This allows the callback function to
**         execute contiguously in time with the interrupt - just as if
**         the callback had executed in the interrupt itself.
**         Functions that can be deferred to the RTOS daemon task must
**         have the following prototype:
**         void vPendableFunction( void * pvParameter1, uint32_t
**         ulParameter2 );
**         The pvParameter1 and ulParameter2 are provided for use by
**         the application code.

**         both be set to 1 for xTimerPendFunctionCallFromISR() to be

**         xFunctionToPend - The function to

**                           The function must conform to the
**                           PendedFunction_t prototype as shown above. 
**       * pvParameter1    -  	The value of the

**         When a task notification value is being used as a binary or

**         should wait for the notification using the ulTaskNotifyTake()
**         API function rather than the xTaskNotifyWait() API function.
**         xTaskNotifyGive() must not be called from an interrupt
**         service routine. Use vTaskNotifyGiveFromISR() instead. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION

**     Description :
**          Each RTOS task has a 32-bit notification value which is
**         initialised to zero when the RTOS task is created. An RTOS
**         task notification is an event sent directly to a task that

**         ulTaskNotifyTake() is intended for use when a task
**         notification is used as a faster and lighter weight binary
**         or counting semaphore alternative. FreeRTOS semaphores are
**         taken using the xSemaphoreTake() API function,
**         ulTaskNotifyTake() is the equivalent that instead uses a
**         task notification.
**         When a task is using its notification value as a binary or
**         counting semaphore other tasks and interrupts should send
**         notifications to it using either the xTaskNotifyGive() macro,
**         or the xTaskNotify() function with the function's eAction
**         parameter set to eIncrement (the two are equivalent).
**         ulTaskNotifyTake() can either clear the task's notification
**         value to zero on exit, in which case the notification value
**         acts like a binary semaphore, or decrement the task's
**         notification value on exit, in which case the notification
**         value acts more like a counting semaphore.
**         An RTOS task can use ulTaskNotifyTake() to [optionally]
**         block to wait for a the task's notification value to be
**         non-zero. The task does not consume any CPU time while it is
**         in the Blocked state.
**         Where as xTaskNotifyWait() will return when a notification
**         is pending, ulTaskNotifyTake() will return when the task's
**         notification value is not zero, decrementing the task's
**         notification value before it returns. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xClearCountOnExit - If an RTOS
**                           task notification is received and
**                           xClearCountOnExit is set to pdFALSE then
**                           the RTOS task's notification value is
**                           decremented before ulTaskNotifyTake() exits.
**                           This is equivalent to the value of a
**                           counting semaphore being decremented by a
**                           successful call to xSemaphoreTake().

**                           to 0 before ulTaskNotifyTake() exits. This
**                           is equivalent to the value of a binary

**         xTicksToWait    - The maximum time to wait
**                           in the Blocked state for a notification to
**                           be received if a notification is not

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xTaskNotify (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**          [If you are using RTOS task notifications to implement
**         binary or counting semaphore type behaviour then use the
**         simpler xTaskNotifyGive() API function instead of
**         xTaskNotify()]
**         Each RTOS task has a 32-bit notification value which is
**         initialised to zero when the RTOS task is created.
**         xTaskNotify() is used to send an event directly to and
**         potentially unblock an RTOS task, and optionally update the
**         receiving task's notification value in one of the following
**         ways:
**         - Write a 32-bit number to the notification value
**         - Add one (increment) the notification value
**         - Set one or more bits in the notification value
**         - Leave the notification value unchanged
**         This function must not be called from an interrupt service
**         routine (ISR). Use xTaskNotifyFromISR() instead. 
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         xTaskToNotify   - The handle of the RTOS
**                           task being notified. This is the subject
**                           task.
**                           RTOS task handles are obtained using the
**                           pvCreatedTask parameter of the xTaskCreate()
**                           call used to create the task.
**                           The handle of the currently executing RTOS
**                           task is returned by the
**                           xTaskGetCurrentTaskHandle() API function. 
**         ulValue         - Used to update the notification
**                           value of the subject task. See the
**                           description of the eAction parameter below. 
**         eAction         - An enumerated type that can take
**                           one of the values documented in the table
**                           below in order to perform the associated
**                           action. 
**                           - eNoAction: 	The subject task receives the
**                           event, but its notification value is not
**                           updated. In this case ulValue is not used.
**                           - eSetBits: 	The notification value of the
**                           subject task will be bitwise ORed with
**                           ulValue. For example, if ulValue is set to
**                           0x01, then bit 0 will get set within the
**                           subject task's notification value. Likewise
**                           if ulValue is 0x04 then bit 2 will get set
**                           in the subject task's notification value.
**                           In this way the RTOS task notification
**                           mechanism can be used as a light weight
**                           alternative to an event group.
**                           - eIncrement: 	The notification value of
**                           the subject task will be incremented by one,
**                           making the call to xTaskNotify() equivalent
**                           to a call to xTaskNotifyGive(). In this
**                           case ulValue is not used.
**                           - eSetValueWithOverwrite: 	The notification
**                           value of the subject task is
**                           unconditionally set to ulValue. In this way
**                           the RTOS task notification mechanism is
**                           being used as a light weight alternative to
**                           xQueueOverwrite().
**                           - eSetValueWithoutOverwrite: 	If the
**                           subject task does not already have a
**                           notification pending then its notification
**                           value will be set to ulValue. If the
**                           subject task already has a notification
**                           pending then its notification value is not
**                           updated as to do so would overwrite the
**                           previous value before it was used. In this
**                           case the call to xTaskNotify() fails and
**                           pdFALSE is returned. In this way the RTOS
**                           task notification mechanism is being used
**                           as a light weight alternative to
**                           xQueueSend() on a queue of length 1. 
**     Returns     :
**         ---             - pdPASS is returned in all cases other than
**                           when eAction is set to
**                           eSetValueWithoutOverwrite and the subject
**                           task's notification value cannot be updated
**                           because the subject task already had a
**                           notification pending.

**         Each RTOS task has a 32-bit notification value which is

**     Description :
**         The old vSemaphoreCreateBinary() macro is now deprecated in
**         favour of this xSemaphoreCreateBinary() function.  Note that
**         binary semaphores created using the vSemaphoreCreateBinary()
**         macro are created in a state such that the first call to
**         'take' the semaphore would pass, whereas binary semaphores
**         created using xSemaphoreCreateBinary() are created in a
**         state such that the the semaphore must first be 'given'
**         before it can be 'taken'.
**         Function that creates a semaphore by using the existing
**         queue mechanism. The queue length is 1 as this is a binary
**         semaphore.  The data size is 0 as nothing is actually stored
**         - all that is important is whether the queue is empty or
**         full (the binary semaphore is available or not).
**         This type of semaphore can be used for pure synchronisation
**         between tasks or between an interrupt and a task.  The
**         semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so one
**         task/interrupt can continuously 'give' the semaphore while
**         another continuously 'takes' the semaphore.  For this reason
**         this type of semaphore does not use a priority inheritance
**         mechanism.  For an alternative that does use priority
**         inheritance see xSemaphoreCreateMutex().
**     Parameters  : None
**     Returns     :

**         Function that creates a semaphore by using the existing

**         This type of semaphore can be used for pure synchronisation
**         between tasks or between an interrupt and a task.  The
**         semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so one

**     Description :
**         Macro that creates a counting semaphore by using the
**         existing queue mechanism.
**         Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:
**         1. Counting events.
**         In this usage scenario an event handler will 'give' a
**         semaphore each time an event occurs (incrementing the
**         semaphore count value), and a handler task will 'take' a
**         semaphore each time it processes an event (decrementing the
**         semaphore count value). The count value is therefore the
**         difference between the number of events that have occurred
**         and the number that have been processed. In this case it is
**         desirable for the initial count value to be zero.
**         2. Resource management.
**         In this usage scenario the count value indicates the number
**         of resources available. To obtain control of a resource a
**         task must first obtain a semaphore - decrementing the
**         semaphore count value. When the count value reaches zero
**         there are no free resources. When a task finishes with the
**         resource it 'gives' the semaphore back - incrementing the
**         semaphore count value. In this case it is desirable for the
**         initial count value to be equal to the maximum count value,
**         indicating that all resources are free.
**     Parameters  :
**         NAME            - DESCRIPTION
**         uxMaxCount      - The maximum count value that
**                           can be reached. When the semaphore reaches
**                           this value it can no longer be 'given'.
**         uxInitialCount  - The count value
**                           assigned to the semaphore when it is
**                           created.
**         pxSempahoreBuffer - Must point to
**                           a variable of type StaticSemaphore_t, which
**                           is then used to hold the semaphore's data

**     Method      :  FRTOS1_xSemaphoreCreateMutexStatic (component FreeRTOS)
**     Description :
**         Macro that creates a mutex semaphore by using the existing
**         queue mechanism.
**         Mutexes created using this macro can be accessed using the
**         xSemaphoreTake() and xSemaphoreGive() macros. The
**         xSemaphoreTakeRecursive() and xSemaphoreGiveRecursive()
**         macros should not be used.
**         Mutexes and binary semaphores are very similar but have some
**         subtle differences: Mutexes include a priority inheritance
**         mechanism, binary semaphores do not. This makes binary
**         semaphores the better choice for implementing
**         synchronisation (between tasks or between tasks and an
**         interrupt), and mutexes the better choice for implementing
**         simple mutual exclusion.
**         The priority of a task that 'takes' a mutex can potentially
**         be raised if another task of higher priority attempts to
**         obtain the same mutex. The task that owns the mutex
**         'inherits' the priority of the task attempting to 'take' the
**         same mutex. This means the mutex must always be 'given' back
**         - otherwise the higher priority task will never be able to
**         obtain the mutex, and the lower priority task will never
**         'disinherit' the priority. An example of a mutex being used
**         to implement mutual exclusion is provided on the
**         xSemaphoreTake() documentation page.
**         A binary semaphore need not be given back once obtained, so
**         task synchronisation can be implemented by one
**         task/interrupt continuously 'giving' the semaphore while
**         another continuously 'takes' the semaphore. This is
**         demonstrated by the sample code on the
**         xSemaphoreGiveFromISR() documentation page.
**         Both mutex and binary semaphores are assigned to variables
**         of type xSemaphoreHandle and can be used in any API function
**         that takes a parameter of this type.

**         state, and total amount of run time consumed by the task. 
**     Parameters  :

**         xGetFreeStackSpace - The
**                           TaskStatus_t structure contains a member to
**                           report the stack high water mark of the
**                           task being queried. The stack high water
**                           mark is the minimum amount of stack space
**                           that has ever existed, so the closer the

**                           come to overflowing its stack.Calculating
**                           the stack high water mark takes a
**                           relatively long time, and can make the

**                           skipped. The high watermark value will only
**                           be written to the TaskStatus_t structure if

**         macros.  The  xSemaphoreTake() and xSemaphoreGive() macros
**         should not be used.
**         A mutex used recursively can be 'taken' repeatedly by the
**         owner. The mutex doesn't become available again until the
**         owner has called xSemaphoreGiveRecursive() for each
**         successful 'take' request.  For example, if a task

**         will not be available to any other task until it has also
**         'given' the mutex back exactly five times.
**         This type of semaphore uses a priority inheritance mechanism
**         so a task 'taking' a semaphore MUST ALWAYS 'give' the
**         semaphore back once the semaphore it is no longer required.
