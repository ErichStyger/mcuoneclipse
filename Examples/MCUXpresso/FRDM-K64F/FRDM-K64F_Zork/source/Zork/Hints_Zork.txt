zork
----
- Note: Robot only (needs >128 KByte of Flash and >64 KByte of RAM)
- Add Zork folder to Sources/Zork
  - add include path to the compiler includes settings: ../Sources/Zork
- FreeRTOS component: enable 'use User memory section' ==> Memory in second bank
- Memory size is wrong in PEx: we have 128 KByte :-)
  a) In the CPU component, Build Options, disabe generation of linker file
  b) extend the two 32KByte RAM blocks to 64 KByte in the linker file (Project Settings > Linker_Files)
  m_data      (RW) : ORIGIN = 0x1fff0000, LENGTH = 0x10000
  m_data_20000000 (RW) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x10000
  c) additionally, change the heap size to
  __heap_size = 0x5000;   

- semihosting:
   a) In the linker setting for the project (Cross ARM C++ Linker > Miscellaneous),
   replace '-specs=nosys.specs' with '-specs=rdimon.specs'
   b) In the launch configuration, enable Semihosting (launch configuration, Startup Tab)
   See: https://mcuoneclipse.com/2015/05/27/semihosting-for-kinetis-design-studio-v3-0-0-and-gnu-arm-embedded-launchpad/

- init and start the game:
  zork_config(); /* initializes the game */
  run_zork_game(); /* run the game, does not return while it is running */

  
Hints:
  - dedicated task to run Zork?
  - add a new PL_CONFIG macro for the feature
  - Shell command to start the game
  - suspend/resume tasks?
  - overwrite/replace _exit(): the game exits that way. Think about what task is doing the _exit, and how you can gracefully exit.

 
 NOTE:
 Instead of using semihosting, it is possible to use and load the game data from FLASH.
 In that case, the data is stored in the file 'dtextc.c'.
 To use the FLASH based data/file, enable USE_FLASH_FILE.
 Keep in mind that currently the save/restore game commands are not implemented if loading data from FLASH.
