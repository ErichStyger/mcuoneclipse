Overview
========
The LED Blinky demo application provides a sanity check for the new SDK build environments and board bring up. The LED Blinky demo 
uses the systick interrupt to realize the function of timing delay. The example takes turns to shine the LED. The purpose of this 
demo is to provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVK-MIMXRT1020 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1. Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2. Download the program to the target board.
3. Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the demo runs successfully, you will find the LED is blinking.

Note:
To debug in qspiflash, following steps are needed:
1. Select the flash target and compile.
3. Set the SW8: 1 off 2 off 3 on 4 off, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J23.
4. Start debugging in IDE.
   - Keil: Click "Download (F8)" to program the image to qspiflash first then clicking "Start/Stop Debug Session (Ctrl+F5)" to start debugging.
