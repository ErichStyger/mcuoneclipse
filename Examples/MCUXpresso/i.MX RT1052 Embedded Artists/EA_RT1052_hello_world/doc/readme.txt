Overview
========
The Hello World demo application provides a sanity check for the new SDK build environments and board bring up. The Hello
World demo prints the "Hello World" string to the terminal using the SDK UART drivers. The purpose of this demo is to
show how to use the UART, and to provide a simple project for debugging and further development.

Toolchain supported
===================
- Keil MDK 5.24a
- IAR embedded Workbench 8.22.2
- GCC ARM Embedded 7-2017-q4-major
- MCUXpresso10.2.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Mini/micro USB cable
- EVKB-IMXRT1050 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a USB cable between the host PC and the OpenSDA USB port on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
The log below shows the output of the hello world demo in the terminal window:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
hello world.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note:
To download binary into hyper flash and boot from hyperflash directly, following steps are needed:
1. Select the target flexspi_nor_debug or flexspi_nor_release.
2. Compile the project, and get the binaray file "hello_world.bin"
3. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 off 3 off 4 on, then power on the board and connect USB cable to J28
4. Drop the binaray into disk "EVK-MIMXRT"
5. Wait for the disk disappear and appear again which will take around ~10s, then power off the board
6. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 on 3 on 4 off, then power on the board
7. After power on the baord, program has already started to run, reset SW4 is recommended. 
 
Note:
To debug in hyper flash in MDK, following steps are needed:
1. Select the target flexspi_nor_debug or flexspi_nor_release.
2. Compile the project.
3. Press F8 or click the download button, to program the application into hyper flash.
4. Set the SW7: 1 off 2 on 3 on 4 off, then power on the board
5. Push SW4 to reset.
6. Start to debug.
