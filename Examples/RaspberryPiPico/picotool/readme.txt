For the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK 2.0.0, a Picotool is required.
The SDK CMake and scripts try to build it if the Picotool is not present or found.
However, on Windows building the picotool might fail.
That's why a binary is provided here.

Instructions:
- Download the zip file and extract it, into 
  C:\Raspy
- Create an environment variable PICO_TOOL_PATH pointing to where you have installed it, e.g.
  PICO_TOOL_PATH=C:\Raspy\picotool\2.0.0\picotool
- In your top-level project CMakeLists.txt, add the line(right after cmake_minimum_required). 
  This ensures that the build is using our picotool binary directly and does not try to build it:
  set(picotool_DIR $ENV{PICO_TOOL_PATH})
